### 1. Project Title

**QuizGame**

---

### 2. Problem Statement

Current solutions for hosting interactive, real-time quiz games in social settings often fall short. They typically lack dynamic content generation, require manual setup of questions, or rely on cumbersome mechanisms for player interaction and answer evaluation. This results in a disjointed, high-effort experience for hosts and a less engaging, delayed experience for players. There's a clear need for a modern, AI-enhanced platform that streamlines game management, automates content and scoring, and provides seamless multi-device interaction for an effortlessly fun group quiz experience.

---

### 3. Goals

The primary goals of the "QuizGame" project are to:

* **Deliver an Engaging User Experience:** Create a highly interactive and intuitive gaming experience for players, with clear visual feedback on the main game board and responsive controls via their mobile phones.
* **Enable Seamless Multiplayer Interaction:** Develop robust real-time communication channels to support multiple players joining, buzzing, and interacting within a single game instance without latency issues.
* **Provide Comprehensive Administrative Control:** Equip game hosts with an intuitive dashboard to manage all aspects of the game, including question flow, player status, scoring, and critical game events.
* **Integrate Intelligent Content Generation and Evaluation:** Leverage advanced AI capabilities (LLMs, voice synthesis, voice recognition) to automate question generation, read questions aloud, capture player answers, and accurately determine correctness, thereby reducing manual intervention and enhancing gameplay.
* **Ensure Adaptability and Customization:** Allow for flexible configuration of game parameters, such as the number of questions, difficulty levels, and categories, to cater to diverse gaming preferences.
* **Optimize for Social Settings:** Design the game to be easily deployable and enjoyable in social gatherings, leveraging large screen displays for collective viewing and individual phones for private interaction.
* **Achieve Technical Stability and Scalability:** Build the game on a reliable and scalable real-time framework (e.g., PartyKit) to ensure smooth performance for multiple concurrent players and future expandability.

### 5. Target Audience

The primary target audience for "QuizGame" is broad, encompassing groups of individuals who enjoy interactive and competitive social activities.

* **Social Gatherings:** Friends and family looking for an engaging activity during parties, get-togethers, or casual hangouts.
* **Event Organizers:** Individuals or groups hosting events (e.g., corporate team-building, community events, school functions) who need a fun and easy-to-manage quiz solution.
* **Casual Gamers:** People who enjoy simple, accessible, and entertaining games that don't require extensive setup or prior gaming experience.
* **Educators/Trainers:** Potentially adaptable for educational or training purposes, though this is not the primary focus for the initial scope.

The game is designed to be accessible to participants with basic smartphone literacy, allowing them to easily join and interact through a web-based interface. The main game board provides a communal viewing experience, catering to audiences who prefer to watch and participate collectively.

### 7. Assumptions

This section outlines the key assumptions being made during the planning and development of "QuizGame." These assumptions are crucial for setting expectations and identifying potential risks if they prove to be incorrect.

* **Internet Connectivity:** It is assumed that all participating devices (main game board, player phones, admin dashboard) will have stable and continuous internet connectivity throughout the game. The game relies heavily on real-time communication.
* **Device Compatibility:** It is assumed that player mobile devices will be modern smartphones with working microphones and web browsers capable of rendering the web-based interface and supporting voice recognition technology.
* **Browser Compatibility:** The web-based interfaces (game board, player, admin) are assumed to be compatible with modern web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) on their respective devices.
* **Third-Party Service Availability & Performance:** The project assumes the reliable availability and performance of third-party services, including:
    * **PartyKit (or chosen real-time framework):** For stable and low-latency real-time communication.
    * **Voice Synthesis API:** For accurate and natural-sounding text-to-speech conversion.
    * **Voice Recognition Library:** For accurate speech-to-text conversion of player answers.
    * **LLM API:** For reliable and accurate question generation and answer evaluation.
* **Voice Recognition Accuracy:** It is assumed that the chosen voice recognition library/service will have sufficient accuracy to correctly transcribe player answers, even in potentially noisy environments, for effective LLM evaluation.
* **LLM Response Time and Cost:** It is assumed that the LLM services will provide responses within acceptable timeframes for real-time gameplay and that the costs associated with their usage will be within budget.
* **User Familiarity with Web Interfaces:** Players and administrators are assumed to have a basic familiarity with navigating web-based interfaces.
* **Scalability Requirements:** Initial development assumes a moderate number of concurrent players (e.g., suitable for a typical social gathering). Extreme scalability for thousands of concurrent users might require further architectural considerations beyond the initial scope.
* **Copyright and Content Rights:** It is assumed that all generated questions and any manually added content will adhere to copyright laws and intellectual property rights.

### 8. Constraints

Constraints are limitations or restrictions that must be considered during the development of "QuizGame." These can include technical, resource, time, or external factors.

* **Technology Stack Limitation (PartyKit preference):** The user has a preference for PartyKit (JS/TS framework), which will be prioritized. While alternatives can be recommended, the initial approach will lean towards this framework, potentially limiting the exploration of other architectures.
* **Reliance on Third-Party AI Services:** The core functionality (question generation, answer evaluation, voice synthesis, voice recognition) is dependent on external LLM and voice service APIs. This introduces dependencies on their availability, performance, cost, and potential API changes.
* **Real-time Performance Requirements:** The game's interactive nature (buzzers, timers, immediate feedback) imposes strict real-time performance constraints, requiring efficient data synchronization and low-latency communication.
* **Web-Based Interface for Players:** The decision to use a web-based interface for player phones, rather than native mobile applications, limits access to certain device-specific functionalities that might be available only through native app development.
* **Security for Admin Dashboard:** As the admin dashboard handles sensitive game controls, robust security measures must be in place to prevent unauthorized access and manipulation.
* **Scalability for Concurrent Players:** While not explicitly high-scale initially, the chosen architecture must be able to handle a reasonable number of concurrent players for social gatherings without performance degradation.
* **Development Timeframe:** While not specified, projects generally operate under an implicit or explicit timeframe, which will influence feature prioritization and complexity.
