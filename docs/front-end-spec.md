### 1. Overview

**Project Name:** QuizGame

**Document Purpose:** This UI/UX Specification document details the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design for the "QuizGame" application. It translates the functional and non-functional requirements outlined in the Product Requirements Document (PRD) into concrete design specifications, including wireframes, mockups (conceptual), user flows, and interaction behaviors for the three primary interfaces: the Main Game Board (TV/Large Display), the Player Mobile Interface, and the Admin Dashboard.

**Scope of this Document:** This document covers the visual layout, interactive elements, navigation structures, and overall user experience for all key screens and interactions within "QuizGame." It aims to provide a clear blueprint for developers and ensure a consistent and intuitive experience for all user roles. It will define the visual hierarchy, component states, and user feedback mechanisms.

**Intended Audience:** This document is primarily intended for the development team (frontend and backend engineers), visual designers, and quality assurance specialists involved in the "QuizGame" project. It also serves as a reference for stakeholders to visualize the proposed user experience.

* **Game Hosts / Administrators:**
    * **Description:** Individuals responsible for setting up, managing, and controlling the quiz game.
    * **Primary Interaction:** Utilize the Admin Dashboard on a computer or tablet to manage game flow, generate and edit questions, control players, and adjust game settings.
    * **Key Needs:** Comprehensive control, intuitive management tools, real-time insights into game state, and the ability to intervene easily when necessary.

* **Audience / Spectators (Implicit via Game Board):**
    * **Description:** Individuals observing the game on the main display screen, even if not actively playing.
    * **Primary Interaction:** Passive viewing of questions, timers, scores, player lists, and winner announcements on the Game Board.

### 5. Open Issues (UI/UX)

This section outlines any outstanding design questions, unresolved UX decisions, or potential challenges that need to be addressed as the "QuizGame" UI/UX specification progresses.

* **OI-UX-001: Detailed Visual Design and Branding:** While conceptual wireframes are provided, the specific color palettes, typography, iconography, and overall branding style for all interfaces need to be defined.
* **OI-UX-002: Animation and Transition Details:** The specifics of animations and transitions between screens (e.g., lobby to question, question to score update, winner announcement) need to be designed to enhance user engagement.
* **OI-UX-003: Accessibility Considerations:** Detailed accessibility requirements for all interfaces (e.g., contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility) need to be fully explored and documented.
* **OI-UX-004: Responsive Design Breakpoints:** Precise breakpoints for responsive design across various screen sizes for the Admin Dashboard and Player Mobile Interface need to be defined.
* **OI-UX-005: Voice Feedback for Buzzer/Timer:** The exact auditory feedback (e.g., sound effects) for buzzer presses, timer warnings, and answer outcomes needs to be determined.
* **OI-UX-006: Micro-interactions and Haptic Feedback:** Opportunities for subtle micro-interactions and haptic feedback on player devices (e.g., on buzzer press) to improve usability should be explored.
* **OI-UX-007: LLM Answer Feedback Display:** The specific way the LLM's answer judgment (correct/incorrect) is visually communicated to the player and on the main game board needs to be designed clearly.
* **OI-UX-008: Error States and User Guidance:** Detailed design for various error states (e.g., network issues, microphone access denied) and the corresponding user guidance needs to be established.
