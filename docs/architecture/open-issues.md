# Open Issues (Architecture)

* **AI Service Provider Selection:** Finalize the specific LLM (e.g., Gemini Pro, GPT-4) and voice synthesis/recognition (e.g., Google Cloud, Azure) providers, considering their performance, cost, and API capabilities.
* **Error Handling and Retry Logic:** Comprehensive strategy for handling network errors, API failures from external services, and other exceptions across all components, including retry mechanisms within PartyKit Endpoints.
* **Monitoring and Logging:** Define the monitoring and logging strategy for the entire application (clients and PartyKit Endpoints) to track performance, errors, and user activity.
* **Deployment Environment Specifics (PartyKit details):** Pin down any specific configurations or environment variables needed for optimized PartyKit deployment.
