# Performance Considerations

* **Optimized Real-time Updates:** Minimize the size of real-time messages and optimize the frequency of state updates managed by PartyKit to reduce network traffic.
* **Efficient Component Rendering:** Utilize React's reconciliation and optimize component re-renders to ensure smooth UI performance, especially on the Game Board.
* **Asynchronous API Calls:** Ensure all calls from PartyKit Endpoints to external LLM and voice services are asynchronous to prevent blocking.
* **Asset Optimization:** Optimize image assets, CSS, and JavaScript bundles to ensure fast loading times for all client applications, especially the Player Mobile Interface.
* **Caching:** Implement caching mechanisms within PartyKit for frequently accessed static content (questions) or LLM responses where appropriate to reduce redundant external API calls.
