# Non-Functional Requirements

This section outlines the quality attributes and constraints that "QuizGame" must satisfy, beyond its core functionalities.

## Performance

* **NFR-PERF-001: Real-time Responsiveness:** The system SHALL ensure real-time responsiveness for critical interactions, particularly for the buzzer mechanism (player presses buzzer, game board updates, other players' buzzers lock out within milliseconds).
* **NFR-PERF-002: Low Latency:** Data synchronization between the game board, player phones, and admin dashboard SHALL have minimal latency to ensure a smooth and fair gameplay experience.
* **NFR-PERF-003: Scalability for Players:** The system SHALL be capable of supporting up to [Number] concurrent players without significant degradation in performance (e.g., lag in buzzer response, delayed question display).
* **NFR-PERF-004: LLM Response Time:** LLM responses for question generation and answer evaluation SHALL be processed and integrated within acceptable timeframes to maintain game flow (e.g., answer evaluation within [X] seconds).

## Security

* **NFR-SEC-001: Admin Dashboard Access:** The Admin Dashboard SHALL not require authentication, allowing direct access for trusted users in a social gathering environment.

## Usability

* **NFR-USAB-001: Intuitive Player Interface:** The Player Mobile Interface SHALL be intuitive and easy to use, requiring minimal instruction for players to join and participate.
* **NFR-USAB-002: User-Friendly Admin Dashboard:** The Admin Dashboard SHALL provide a clear and organized interface for hosts to manage games, questions, and players efficiently.
* **NFR-USAB-003: Clear Visual Feedback:** All game interfaces (game board, PMI, ADM) SHALL provide clear and timely visual feedback on game status, player actions, and scores.

## Reliability

* **NFR-REL-001: System Uptime:** The game system SHALL aim for high availability during active game sessions, minimizing unexpected downtime or disconnections.
* **NFR-REL-002: Error Handling:** The system SHALL gracefully handle errors and unexpected inputs (e.g., network interruptions, invalid player actions) without crashing or corrupting game state.
* **NFR-REL-003: Data Consistency:** The game state and scores SHALL remain consistent across all synchronized interfaces.

## Maintainability & Extensibility

* **NFR-MAINT-001: Modular Architecture:** The system SHALL be designed with a modular architecture to facilitate future enhancements, bug fixes, and integration of new features or technologies.
* **NFR-MAINT-002: Code Quality:** The codebase SHALL adhere to industry best practices for readability, documentation, and maintainability.
* **NFR-MAINT-003: Configurable Parameters:** Key game parameters (e.g., number of questions, scoring logic, timer durations) SHALL be easily configurable without requiring code changes.

## Compatibility

* **NFR-COMP-001: Browser Compatibility:** The web interfaces SHALL be compatible with the latest two major versions of popular modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
