# Story 1.1: Project Setup and PartyKit Integration

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up the initial project structure with PartyKit integration and basic React application framework,
**so that** we have a solid foundation for building the three QuizGame interfaces (Game Board, Player Mobile Interface, Admin Dashboard) with real-time communication capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Project structure follows the architecture specifications with separate directories for each interface
2. PartyKit server is configured and running with basic WebSocket connectivity
3. React application is set up with Tanstack Router for navigation
4. Basic state management is configured using Zustand
5. Development environment is properly configured with all necessary dependencies
6. Project can be built and deployed according to the deployment strategy
7. Basic real-time communication test between clients and PartyKit server is working

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Initialize React project with TypeScript and Tanstack Router (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create project structure with separate apps for Game Board, Player Interface, and Admin Dashboard
  - [ ] Configure Tanstack Router for navigation between interfaces
  - [ ] Set up TypeScript configuration and linting
- [ ] Set up PartyKit server and real-time communication (AC: 2, 7)
  - [ ] Install and configure PartyKit dependencies
  - [ ] Create basic PartyKit server with WebSocket endpoints
  - [ ] Implement basic real-time message handling
  - [ ] Test WebSocket connectivity between server and clients
- [ ] Configure state management with Zustand (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Set up Zustand store for game state management
  - [ ] Create basic state structure for players, game status, and scores
  - [ ] Integrate Zustand with PartyKit for real-time state synchronization
- [ ] Set up development environment and build configuration (AC: 5, 6)
  - [ ] Configure Vite or similar build tool for development
  - [ ] Set up Tailwind CSS for styling
  - [ ] Configure environment variables for different deployment environments
  - [ ] Set up deployment configuration for PartyKit and static assets
- [ ] Create basic project structure following architecture guidelines (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Organize components according to the three main interfaces
  - [ ] Set up shared utilities and components
  - [ ] Create proper file naming conventions and directory structure

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories exist - this is the foundational story.

### Data Models
Based on the architecture requirements, the following data structures will be needed:
- **Game State**: [Source: docs/architecture/data-flow.md#Game State Management]
- **Player Data**: [Source: docs/architecture/core-components.md#Player Mobile Interface]
- **Question Data**: [Source: docs/architecture/core-components.md#Admin Dashboard]

### API Specifications
- **PartyKit WebSocket Endpoints**: [Source: docs/architecture/data-flow.md#Player Join]
- **Real-time Communication**: [Source: docs/architecture/architecture-diagram.md#Real-time Communication & Backend Logic]

### Component Specifications
- **Shared Components**: [Source: docs/architecture/core-components.md#Shared Components/Utilities]
  - Real-time Client (PartyKit)
  - State Management (Zustand/React Context)
  - Utility Functions (Timer logic, score calculation, data formatting)

### File Locations
Based on the architecture, create the following structure:
```
src/
├── apps/
│   ├── game-board/          # Main Game Board (TV/Large Display)
│   ├── player-interface/    # Player Mobile Interface
│   └── admin-dashboard/     # Admin Dashboard
├── shared/
│   ├── components/          # Shared UI components
│   ├── utils/              # Utility functions
│   ├── stores/             # Zustand state management
│   └── types/              # TypeScript type definitions
├── partykit/               # PartyKit server logic
└── styles/                 # Global styles and Tailwind config
```

### Technical Constraints
- **Frontend Framework**: React with Tanstack Router [Source: docs/architecture/technology-stack-justification.md#Frontend Framework]
- **Real-time Communication**: PartyKit (JS/TS Framework) [Source: docs/architecture/technology-stack-justification.md#Real-time Communication & Backend Logic]
- **State Management**: Zustand / React Context [Source: docs/architecture/technology-stack-justification.md#State Management]
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS [Source: docs/architecture/technology-stack-justification.md#Styling]

### Testing Requirements
No specific testing guidance found in architecture docs - will need to establish testing standards in future stories.

## Testing
Testing standards to be established in subsequent stories. For this foundational story, focus on:
- Build process verification
- WebSocket connectivity testing
- Basic component rendering tests
